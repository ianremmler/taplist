Taplist gets the list of beers on tap at a bar from taplister and prints them
to your terminal.  Find your bar on taplister.com, and grab the id from the end
of the url.  For example, the URL for Black Star Co-op in Austin, TX is:

  http://www.taplister.com/bars/4b888dbbf964a520480032e3

To find out what's on tap:

  > taplist 4b888dbbf964a520480032e3

You can also create a file called .taplistrc in your home directory that
contains bar ids followed by a name (or initials, or nickname, or whatever).
An entry for the above example:

  4b888dbbf964a520480032e3 Black Star Co-op

Then you can find out what's on tap by giving part or all of the bar name:

  > taplist black

Disclaimer: I have no clue if or when taplister will change the id format or
HTML and completely break the thing.

Have an appropriate amount of fun!
